- For a Java DB installation, set the DERBY_HOME environment variable, described in Setting the environment variables, 
to JAVA_HOME/db.
DERBY_HOME = %JAVA_HOME%\db or the actual derby installation folder
To path add %DERBY_HOME%\bin

To check from command prompt run:
echo %DERBY_HOME%

--- running derby in a client/server mode (if the jdk in is a directory with spaces apply double quotes around the file path)
java -jar %DERBY_HOME%\lib\derbyrun.jar server start

--We can either use an SQL client like Squirrel to access the datbase or use ij which is the derby command line tool
We don't need to pass a user name or pwd to connec to a derby Db. The derby db name is passed as part of the URL during DB 
connection initially. However if we do pass a user name and pwd to a derby db during JDBC connection, then the user name becomes the DB (or schema) name.

Accordingly from the java side we need to either pass the user name and password or omit the same. 

- create database and tables from command prompt
ij
#to create spring_train db
#create table
#insert data

#CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:spring_train;create=true'; also works (no need for user name or pwd
    CONNECT 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/spring_train;create=true';


CREATE TABLE pet
    (id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    owner VARCHAR(20),
    species VARCHAR(20),
    sex char(1),
    birth date,
    death date);

insert into pet values(1, 'Jewel', 'Deepak', 'cat', 'f', '1990-01-01', '1998-01-01');
insert into pet values(2, 'Judy', 'Sunita', 'dog', 'f', '1991-01-01', '1999-01-01');
insert into pet values(3, 'Pappu', 'Rakesh', 'dog', 'm', '1991-01-01', '1999-01-01');
insert into pet values(4, 'Caesar', 'Chandan', 'dog', 'm', '1991-01-01', '1999-01-01');
insert into pet values(5, 'Einstein', 'Sonam', 'dog', 'm', '1991-01-01', '1999-01-01');

select * from pet;


- to reconnect to db
run
ij
CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:spring_train;create=false'; //false or true will work, it will not recreate the db.
